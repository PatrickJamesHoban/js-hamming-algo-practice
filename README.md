# JavaScript Algorithm Practice

## Write a function that computes the nth smallest Hamming number.

### Challenge:

Write a function or set of functions that takes...

- A number.

And returns...

- first letter in the string that is not repeated anywhere else in the string.
- an empty string in the case that there are no unique characters / letters.

NOTE:

- A Hamming # is (2^i)(3^j)(5^k)
- Should be able to compute all of the smallest 5,000 Hamming numbers without timing out.
